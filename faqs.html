            <h2>FAQs about COVID-19</h2>
            <p><strong>Detail Question and Answers on COVID-19 for Public</strong><br><strong>What is
                    coronavirus</strong><br>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness<br>in
                animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known<br>to cause respiratory infections ranging
                from the common cold to more<br>severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)<br>and
                Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently<br>discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus
                disease COVID-19.<br><strong>What is COVID-19</strong><br>COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by
                the most recently<br>discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown<br>before the
                outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.<br><strong>What are the symptoms of
                    COVID-19</strong><br>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and<br>dry cough.
                Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal<br>congestion, runny nose, sore throat, or diarrhea. These
                symptoms are<br>usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but<br>don’t develop any
                symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people<br>(about 80%) recover from the disease without needing
                special<br>treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who get COVID-19<br>becomes seriously ill and
                develops difficulty breathing. Older people,<br>and those with underlying medical problems like high
                blood pressure,<br>heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.<br>People
                with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical<br>attention.<br><strong>How does
                    COVID-19 spread</strong><br>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The<br>disease
                can spread from person to person through small droplets from<br>the nose or mouth which are spread when
                a person with COVID-19<br>coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces<br>around the
                person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching<br>these objects or surfaces, then touching their
                eyes, nose, or mouth.<br>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a<br>person
                with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is<br>why it is important to stay more than 1
                meter (3 feet) away from a<br>person who is sick.<br><strong>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 to be
                    transmitted through the air?</strong><br><strong>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes
                    COVID-19 is mainly</strong><br><strong>transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather
                    than</strong><br><strong>through the air. See the previous answer on “How does
                    COVID-19</strong><br><strong>spread?”</strong><br><strong>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who
                    has no symptoms?</strong><br>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory
                droplets<br>expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19<br>from someone with no
                symptoms at all is very low. However, many<br>people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This
                is<br>particularly true in the early stages of the disease. It is therefore<br>possible to catch
                COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just<br>a mild cough and does not feel ill.<br>Can I catch
                COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?<br>The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of
                an infected person<br>appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may<br>be
                present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a<br>main feature of the outbreak. The
                ongoing research on the ways<br>COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.
                Because<br>this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,<br>after using the
                bathroom and before eating.<br>What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread
                of<br>disease<br>Protection measures for everyone<br>Stay aware of the latest information on the
                COVID-19 outbreak,<br>available on the national, state, and local public health authority.
                Many<br>countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several<br>have seen outbreaks.
                Authorities in China and some other countries<br>have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks.
                However, the<br>situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.<br>You can reduce
                your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-<br>19 by taking some simple precautions:<br>•
                Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based<br>hand rubs or wash them with soap and
                water.<br>Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using<br>alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses
                that may be on your hands.<br>• Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself
                and<br>anyone who is coughing or sneezing.<br>Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small
                liquid<br>droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain viruses. If you<br>are too close, you can
                breathe in the droplets, including the<br>COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.<br>•
                Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth.<br>Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.<br>Once
                contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,<br>nose or mouth. From there, the virus can
                enter your body and<br>can make you sick.<br>• Make sure you, and the people around you, follow
                good<br>respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose<br>with your bent elbow or tissue
                when you cough or sneeze. Then<br>dispose of the used tissue immediately.<br>Why? Droplets spread virus.
                By following good respiratory<br>hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as<br>cold,
                flu and COVID-19.<br>• Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and<br>difficulty
                breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.<br>Follow the directions of your local health
                authority.<br>Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date<br>information on the
                situation in your area. Calling in advance will<br>allow your health care provider to quickly direct you
                to the right<br>health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread<br>of viruses and
                other infections.<br>• Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local<br>areas where
                COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid<br>traveling to places – especially if you are an
                older person or<br>have diabetes, heart or lung disease.<br>Why? You have a higher chance of catching
                COVID-19 in one of<br>these areas.<br>Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently
                visited (past<br>14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading<br>o Follow the guidance outlined above
                (Protection measures for<br>everyone)<br>o Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell,
                even<br>with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C<br>or above) and slight runny nose,
                until you recover. If it is<br>essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go<br>out,
                e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other<br>people.<br>Why? Avoiding contact with
                others and visits to medical facilities<br>will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and
                help<br>protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other<br>viruses.<br>o If you develop fever,
                cough and difficulty breathing, seek<br>medical advice promptly as this may be due to a
                respiratory<br>infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your<br>provider of any
                recent travel or contact with travelers.<br>Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider
                to<br>quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to<br>prevent possible spread
                of COVID-19 and other viruses.<br>How likely am I to catch COVID-19?<br>The risk depends on where you
                are - and more specifically, whether<br>there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.<br>For most people
                in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is<br>still low. However, there are now places around
                the world (cities or<br>areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or
                visiting,<br>these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments<br>and health authorities
                are taking vigorous action every time a new<br>case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with
                any local<br>restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with<br>disease control
                efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading<br>COVID-19.<br>COVID-19 outbreaks can be
                contained and transmission stopped, as<br>has been shown in China and some other countries.
                Unfortunately,<br>new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the<br>situation where
                you are or intend to go.<br>Should I worry about COVID-19?<br>Illness due to COVID-19 infection is
                generally mild, especially for<br>children and young adults. However, it can cause serious
                illness:<br>about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is<br>therefore quite normal
                for people to worry about how the COVID-19<br>outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.<br>We can
                channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our<br>loved ones and our communities. First and
                foremost among these<br>actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory<br>hygiene.
                Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local<br>health authorities including any
                restrictions put in place on travel,<br>movement and gatherings.<br>Who is at risk of developing severe
                illness<br>While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people,<br>older persons and persons
                with pre-existing medical conditions (such<br>as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease,
                cancer or<br>diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.<br>Are antibiotics
                effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?<br>No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they
                only work on<br>bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do<br>not work.
                Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or<br>treatment of COVID-19. They should only be
                used as directed by a<br>physician to treat a bacterial infection.<br>Are there any medicines or
                therapies that can prevent or cure<br>COVID-19<br>While some western, traditional or home remedies may
                provide<br>comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence<br>that current medicine can
                prevent or cure the disease. We does not<br>recommend self-medication with any medicines, including
                antibiotics,<br>as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several<br>ongoing clinical
                trials that include both western and traditional<br>medicines. We will continue to provide updated
                information as soon<br>as clinical findings are available.<br>Is there a vaccine drug or treatment for
                COVID-19<br>Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine<br>to prevent or
                treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should<br>receive care to relieve symptoms. People with
                serious illness should<br>be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.<br>Possible
                vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under<br>investigation. They are being tested through
                clinical trials.<br>The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against<br>COVID-19 are to
                frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with<br>the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a
                distance of at least 1<br>meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing<br>Is COVID-19 the
                same as SARS?<br>No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the<br>outbreak of Severe
                Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are<br>related to each other genetically, but the diseases
                they cause are<br>quite different.<br>SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than
                COVID-19.<br>There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since<br>2003.<br>Should I wear
                mask to protect myself<br>Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms
                (especially<br>coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.<br>Disposable face mask can
                only be used once. If you are not ill or<br>looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a
                mask. There is<br>a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks<br>wisely.<br>We
                advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary<br>wastage of precious resources and mis-use
                of masks The most<br>effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to<br>frequently
                clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow<br>or tissue and maintain a distance of at
                least 1 meter (3 feet) from<br>people who are coughing or sneezing.<br>How to put on use take off and
                dispose of a mask?<br>1. Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers,<br>and
                individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.<br>2. Before touching the mask, clean
                hands with an alcohol-based<br>hand rub or soap and water<br>3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears
                or holes.<br>4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).<br>5. Ensure the proper
                side of the mask faces outwards (the<br>coloured side).<br>6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the
                metal strip or stiff edge of<br>the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.<br>7. Pull down the
                mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your<br>chin.<br>8. After use, take off the mask; remove the
                elastic loops from<br>behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face<br>and clothes, to
                avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces<br>of the mask.<br>9. Discard the mask in a closed bin
                immediately after use.<br>10. Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the<br>mask – Use
                alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash<br>your hands with soap and water.<br>How long is the
                incubation period for COVID-19?<br>The “incubation period” means the time between catching the
                virus<br>and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of<br>the incubation period for
                COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most<br>commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as
                more<br>data become available.<br>Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an
                animal<br>source?<br>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in<br>animals.
                Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which<br>may then spread to other people. For
                example, SARS-CoV was<br>associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by<br>dromedary camels.
                Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not<br>yet been confirmed.<br>To protect yourself, such as when
                visiting live animal markets, avoid<br>direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with
                animals.<br>Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk<br>or animal organs
                with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods<br>and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal
                products.<br>Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?<br>While there has been one instance of a dog being
                infected in Hong<br>Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can<br>transmit
                COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets<br>produced when an infected person coughs,
                sneezes, or speaks. To<br>protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.<br>We continues
                to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID-<br>19 topics and will update as new findings are
                available.<br>How long does the virus survive on surfaces?<br>It is not certain how long the virus that
                causes COVID-19 survives on<br>surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses.
                Studies<br>suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the<br>COVID-19 virus) may
                persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to<br>several days. This may vary under different conditions
                (e.g. type of<br>surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).<br>If you think a surface may be
                infected, clean it with simple disinfectant<br>to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean
                your hands with<br>an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid<br>touching your
                eyes, mouth, or nose.<br>Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has<br>been
                reported?<br>Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial<br>goods is low and the
                risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19<br>from a package that has been moved, travelled, and
                exposed to<br>different conditions and temperature is also low.<br>Is there anything I should not
                do?<br>The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and<br>can be harmful:<br>•
                Smoking<br>• Wearing multiple masks<br>• Taking antibiotics (See question 10 "Are there any medicines
                of<br>therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?")<br>In any case, if you have fever, cough and
                difficulty breathing<br>seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more<br>severe
                infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with<br>your health care provider.</p>
